# LifeLens
LifeLens is an AI-powered multimodal long-term memory companion designed to assist individuals with early-stage dementia. It captures daily moments through images, audio notes, and text, stores them in Qdrant, and retrieves them using semantic search + LLaMA 3 to help users recall people, events, and important information.
